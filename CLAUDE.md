# Open Decision & Scout AI — Branding & UI Guidelines

## Brand Colors

- **Primary Color:** Mint Green (leaning bluer on the spectrum, e.g., "Icy Mint," "Geyser," "Swans Down")
  - HEX examples: #CAFAED, #D4F1F4, #E0F8F7 *(final values to be confirmed based on Matt's browser/system settings and screenshots)*
- **Secondary Colors:** Minimalist whites and very light grays for backgrounds and panel distinctions
- **Accent Colors:** Subtle variations of mint green for highlights or component separation, avoiding strong contrasting colors to keep a calm, decision-focused look

## UI/Button Design Instructions

### AI Buttons (Scout AI, Compass Logo)
- Should be modern, "bubbly," and include subtle or smooth animation to suggest responsiveness and life (e.g., animated direction on the compass logo or a blinking effect)
- Rounded corners and a playful, friendly appearance set these apart in the interface
- Use the primary mint green with accent variations as needed for hover/focus states

### All Other Buttons (Non-AI)
- Should follow inspiration from Airtable and similar tools:
  - **Boxy, minimal, and clean:** More squared corners, clear outlines, no rounded "bubble" style
  - **Flat and modern:** No excessive gradients or shadows
  - **Palette:** Keep these in simple white, gray, or secondary mint variants; do *not* use the bubbly or animated style reserved for the AI
- **Usage:** Only use color or animation for clear, user-focused feedback (e.g., hover/focus state), but no continuous animation

### Backgrounds and Sections
- Major portions of the UI (sidebars, panels, tables) use white or very light mint/gray backgrounds for clarity
- "Bubble" and boxed elements should stand out only for functional emphasis—not for every interface item

## Core Differentiation

- **Scout AI (Compass logo) is visually distinct from all other buttons:** Through animation, color saturation, and playful shape
- **Utility/control buttons:** Remain professional, neutral, and consistent—boxy, minimal, and reminiscent of Airtable's utilitarian style

## Summary

Style and structure the UI for Open Decision and Scout AI with:
1. Mint green (blue-leaning) as the primary color
2. Minimalist whites/grays for backgrounds
3. Two button categories:
   - **AI buttons:** Animated, bubbly, mint-colored (for Scout/Compass)
   - **Non-AI buttons:** Flat, boxy, minimal (Airtable-inspired)
4. Do not mix styles between these groups
5. Ensure backgrounds and content blocks are clean, with only subtle distinctions using the brand palette
